# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to take an in-depth look at employees nearing retirement at Pewlett Hackard. Once this information had been sorted out of the given CSV files, the next steps were to count the number of employees nearing retirement based on title, and then create a list of employees eligible for a possible mentorship program led by the employees nearing retirement. Once these tasks had been completed, the company would have a better idea of how many employees may be leaving soon, and how to establish a way to utilize their experience to mentor qualified employees.

### Results
-Retiring Employees Based on Title
  - As seen in the image, there is a total of 72,458 employees nearing retirement age, thus increasing the demand to either     start searching for new employees, or to start a mentorship program to lessen the damage from such a large number of       the workforce retiring all at once.
  - Of the total staff retiring, 50,842 of those employees are considered senior staff, meaning they could be harder to         find a replacement for. However, this does leave the opportunity to promote current staff to the level of senior in         their position as it could be easier to replace a less experienced employee at a lower level.
  - The image also displays that only 2 retiring employees are currently employed at a managerial level. This again leaves     the option of promoting from within to fill the management void, or shows that management could be an area lacking         adequate employment within the company.
  - Finally, 1,090 retiring employees are assitant engineers. This number could become easier to deal with if for every         1.5-2 assistant engineers retiring, 1 full-time engineer was employed.

  -Utilizing these staff members as mentors could lessen the blow received from mass retirement within the company.            Additionally, the use of experienced and trusted staff could create a foundation that yields both higher quantity and      quality of future work done by current staff members.
